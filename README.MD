### Theme Check Submission Note

Exclude development dependencies and build tooling. Make sure your distributable ZIP does not include `node_modules/`, source files, or any build configuration files. The Theme Directory forbids bundling development tools. Use a `.distignore` file or an exclude pattern when creating your ZIP.

For example, you can include this in your readme or theme submission note:

⚙️ **Build Note:**
Development dependencies (e.g. `node_modules/`, `src/`, and build configs) are excluded from the final distributable using a `.distignore` file and/or `zip -r` exclude command.

```
